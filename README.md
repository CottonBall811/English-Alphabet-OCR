This is a simple program to build a model for recognizing English letters. By neural network, this program can be run to build a model and improve it and reaches a accuracy about 99 percent.
## How it work
Neural network is the most popular machine learning model in Artificial Intelligence industry, which is stimulating human's neural network. By adjusting the values of weight and bias, which are neural network parameters, the model can be promoted in the period of training.
Several neurons make up a layers and several layers make up the neural network. There are three fundamental layers, an input layer, several inner layers and an output layer. The data is transmitted to the inner layer. After calculating and passing through the inner layers, the result is outputed by the output layer.
The structure of the neural network is shown in the following figure.
